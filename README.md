# python-unittesting-example-2025

A small example project to demonstrate how to write unit tests in Python.


## Setting up the project

* Install the requirements (preferably in your virtual environment):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## Notes

* Files `logic_before.py` and `test_logic_before.py` contain the code and tests before refactoring.
* Files `logic_after.py` and `test_logic_after.py` contain the code and tests after refactoring.

Both test files contain extra notes in the form of comments.
